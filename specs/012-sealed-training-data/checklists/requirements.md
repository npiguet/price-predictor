# Specification Quality Checklist: Sealed Training Data Generation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- FR-008 references `python -m sealed match-outcomes` which is an invocation detail from the source spec. This is borderline implementation detail but is retained because it defines the user-facing CLI interface, which is part of the feature's external contract.
- The spec references the forge-connector module and Forge AI in assumptions — these are existing system dependencies, not implementation choices.
- All items pass validation.
